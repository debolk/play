## Issues

This file describes some of the issues we've encountered during the 2013 LAN-party at De Bolk. These issues are prioritised using MoSCoW. Currently, the system was neither useable nor useful to the visitors of the LAN-party. We remain confident that there's a market for this type of supportive software, but that the current execution is just too weak.

### Must have
* Better performance
* Stress testing
* Basic monitoring implemented (newrelic?)
* A way for a user to indicate what game he's playing right now
* A visualisation of list of that data in aggregate (which games are being played right now?)

### Should have
* A way to find a specific user in a game (what game is Jakob playing right now?)
* A way to find player lists in games (who are playing Call of Duty 2 right now?)
* A more intuitive interface

### Could have
* Automatically determine which games are played by clients

### Won't have
