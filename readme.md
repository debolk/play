## Play! with friends

### About

Play! with friends is a small service by Jakob that makes it easier to decide which games to play. Enter your name, set your availability and select the games you want to play; Play! will tell you and your friends who's willing an' able to join the fray!

Important: keep this page open while gaming! To prevent stale information, non-responding users will be purged from the system with extreme prejudice.

### Technical information
Play! is built using [Laravel 4](http://www.laravel.com). Install using [Composer](http://www.getcomposer.org). Make sure to copy and adapt both `public/.htaccess.example` and `app/config/database.example.php`

### Administration
A basic administration interface is provided to add games, destroy games and manually purge users. This interface is coded inline with the user interface and accessed through clicking the link "I'm an admin, really!". Set the secret code in `public\.htaccess`.
